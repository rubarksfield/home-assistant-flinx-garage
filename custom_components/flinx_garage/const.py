BLE_COMMAND_CONNECT_WAIT = 6  # seconds

# Upper bound on a single GATT write. A write through a BLE proxy waits for the
# device's write response and can hang for the proxy's own timeout (30s with
# ESPHome) if the device never answers. Commands must reach the door long before
# that, so writes fail fast and fall back to the cloud instead.
BLE_WRITE_TIMEOUT = 5  # seconds

# that from wedging _ble_connecting and frees the connection slot.
